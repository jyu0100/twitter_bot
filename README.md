## Set up notes

### How to install Tweepy

First, check your Python version with ``python3 --version`` or ``python --version`` on console (terminal/shell/command prompt).

#### If you don't have Python 3 installed (if the above command fails):

Either install Python 3 on your computer OR use something like PythonAnywhere.

#### If you have Python 3.7, you can just run:

``pip3 install tweepy``

If the above command doesn't work, try replacing ``pip3`` with ``pip`` also.

## Files
- **my_twitter_bot.py** - This is the main file that includes all the logic. All the keys are my own.
- **last_seen_id.txt** - This will contain the ID of the tweet that my_twitter_bot.py has seen last. If you see any errors when running the main file, try replacing the content with the ID of one of the tweets you want to examine.
